### Welcome to my Github Page!


- 👀 I’m interested mostly in Linux and BSD systems, and would love to pursue a career configuring and maintaining them. I also very much enjoy home labbing, mostly with devices destined for the dump will that still run open source stuff great.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning LFCSA-level Linux, AWS, and working to imporove my Python and networking skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I'm capable of contributing to in a meaningful way
- 📫 You can reach me at sjstone91@tutanota.com
